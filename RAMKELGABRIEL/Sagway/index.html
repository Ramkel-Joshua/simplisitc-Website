            <p>My first day of the trip! I can’t believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I am on a Segway, I wasn’t able to bring lot with me. I was only able to bring the essentials such as Cell Phone, iPad, digital Camera, and a protein bar. However, as Lee Tan would have said, <q> journey of a thousand miles starts with one step Segway.</q>

            <p>I saw some interesting things on the side of the road today. “Passing cars when you can’t see, may get you a little glimpse of eternity.”</p>
            <p>I definitely won’t be passing any car.</p>

            <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Limuru, Nakuru, Naivasha, Machaskos, and many other places.</p>

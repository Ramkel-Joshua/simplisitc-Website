        <p>My first day of the trip! I canâ€™t believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I am on a<br/> Segway, I wasnâ€™t able to bring lot with me. I was only able to bring the essentials such as Cell Phone,<br/> iPad, digital Camera, and a protein bar. However, as Lee Tan would have said, <q>journey of a thousand miles<br/> starts with one step Segway.</q> </p>

        <p>I saw some interesting things on the side of the road today. â€œPassing cars when you canâ€™t see, may get<br/> you a little glimpse of eternity.â€
</p>
        <p>I definitely wonâ€™t be passing any car.

        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Limuru, Nakuru,<br/> Naivasha, Machaskos, and many other places.
